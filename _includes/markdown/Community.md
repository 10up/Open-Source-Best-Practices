A README, Code of conduct, Contributing, License, Security policy, Issue templates, and Pull request template should all exist on each repository.  The 10up standard for each of these (except README and LICENSE) are noted in the [10up .github repository](https://github.com/10up/.github) and will appear in all 10up repositories unless a local one is created so feel free to leverage the default files unless it's necessary and reasonable to create custom ones local to your repository.

### README outline

Each README.md file should follow a similar outline including the items below (as feasible and makes sense).

#### Title and Description

Ideally we have a (less than 100px in height) logo image we can use with the repository name as fallback.  Below that should be the description in pullquote form.  Finally any applicable badges for the repository should be displayed (e.g., build status, code coverage, stable release version, support level, WP tested up to, license, dependencies, number of contributors).

#### Features

List short bulleted items on the major features/benefits of the plugin/toolkit.  After the bulleted list, we should end with “For more details on changes in each release, check out CHANGELOG.md.”

#### Requirements

This is an optional section, but should be included and list WordPress, PHP, etc. versions that are required as well as any additional plugins/themes/etc. for the plugin/tool to function properly.

#### Installation

This is an optional section, but should include any unique install steps besides the normal “search in WP Admin” / “upload ZIP” steps.

#### Setup

This is an optional section, but should include simple screenshots and basic instructions for any setup or settings required to configure the plugin/tool.

#### Support Level

Check the “[Support Levels](https://10up.github.io/Open-Source-Best-Practices/github-process/#support-levels)” section for details on what to include here.

#### Known Caveats / Issues

This is an optional section, but should include any issues, bugs, or things to note about the plugin/tool that a user might encounter while using it.

#### Changelog

<!-- @todo: add details for this section-->

#### Contributing

Verbatim with correct MD file links: “Please read CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for details on our code of conduct, CONTRIBUTING.md for details on the process for submitting pull requests to us, and CREDITS.md for a list of maintainers, contributors, and libraries used in this repository.”

#### 10up promo

At the end of the README should be the standard 10up Hiring promotion image with a link back to https://10up.com/contact/.  See examples on [Distributor](https://github.com/10up/distributor/#like-what-you-see) and [ClassifAI](https://github.com/10up/classifai#like-what-you-see).
